# 🏰 The Jousting Game v1.1

A medieval-themed **browser-based jousting game** developed as part of the **Engineering Exploration Lab (EEL)** at **MMCOE (Marathwada Mitramandal's College of Engineering)**.  
Built using **JavaScript (p5.js)**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **AutoCAD** for visuals, this project reflects creativity, collaboration, and hands-on learning.
